# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
* STM32 IDE

# COMPONENTS:
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER 

# DESCRIPTION:
* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm速 Cortex速-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded

# STM32F407VG:

* The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family depends on the superior execution Arm速 Cortex速-M4 32-digit RISC center working at a recurrence of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 center highlights a Floating point unit (FPU) single accuracy which upholds all Arm single-accuracy information handling directions and information types. It likewise executes a full arrangement of DSP directions and a memory insurance unit (MPU) which upgrades application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family integrates fast installed.

# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER:
* Adaptable static memory regulator supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND recollections.
* 512 bytes of OTP memory.
* Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
* Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.

# WORKING PRINCIPLE:

* Accept that the car is the microcontroller. Assuming the button is hit, the principal drove (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will begin, and the subsequent drove (blue) will turn on for an ideal rate. Assuming the button is squeezed once more, the third driven (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be expanded in contrast with the past one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth driven (orange), and the wiper speed will be expanded as per the past one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is switched off after the fifth snap.

# USES:
* The functional speed of a vehicle wiper is constrained by a wiper speed control instrument in view of downpour conditions. To produce, the control framework consolidates a downpour sensor (30) that identifies downpour conditions. The plentifulness of a simple sign relies upon the distinguished downpour conditions.
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
* A wiper speed control framework for a car deals with the wiper's working velocity in light of weather patterns.
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall.
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
